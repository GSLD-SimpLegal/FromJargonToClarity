These types of claims can affect the ownership and use of a property, so it's good to know what liens exist on a piece of land. For example, a mortgage is a type of lien that allows a lender to claim ownership of a property if the borrower defaults on the loan.

Promissory Note #14248 dated 5/11/2014 in the original amount of $2,000,000.00 from Borrower to Lender. DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL. All Business Assets per Commercial Security Agreement dated 5/11/2014. DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS. Extend maturity date to 5/11/2017. PROMISE TO PAY. Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. (\"Borrower\") promises to pay to Venture Bank (\"Lender\"), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Two Million & 00/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) or so much as may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance. Interest shall be calculated from the date of each advance until repayment of each advance. PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on May 11, 2017. In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning June 11, 2016, with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first to any accrued unpaid interest; then to principal; then to any unpaid collection costs; and then to any late charges. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing. VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this loan is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime rate of interest as published each business day by the Wall Street Journal (the \"Index\"). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each day. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 3.500% per annum. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this loan will be calculated as described in the \"INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD\" paragraph using a rate equal to the Index, rounded to the nearest percent, adjusted if necessary for any minimum and maximum rate limitations described below, resulting in an initial rate of 3.500% per annum based on a year of 360 days. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this loan be less than 3.250% per annum or more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this loan is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest payable under this loan is computed using this method. This calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in the loan documents. PREPAYMENT. Borrower agrees that all loan fees and other prepaid finance charges are earned fully as of the date of the loan and will not be subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of default), except as otherwise required by law. Except for the foregoing, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather, early payments will reduce the principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked \"paid in full\", \"without recourse\", or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this Agreement, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes \"payment in full\" of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Venture Bank, P.O. Box 9180 Minneapolis, MN 55480-9180. LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged 5.000% of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment or $50.00, whichever is greater. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this loan shall be increased by adding an additional 6.000 percentage point margin (\"Default Rate Margin\"). The Default Rate Margin shall also apply to each succeeding interest rate change that would have applied had there been no default. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: Payment Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. Other Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower. False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. Insolvency. The dissolution or termination of Borrower's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower. ---|--- ", "preferred": " payment of any applicable late charges, all loan fees and prepaid finance charges will be paid in full at the time of loan origination.

LENDER'S RIGHTS. Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal balance under this Agreement and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and then Borrower will pay that amount. ATTORNEYS' FEES; EXPENSES. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help collect this Agreement if Borrower does not pay. Borrower will pay Lender that amount. This includes, subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. If not prohibited by applicable law, Borrower also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of Minnesota. DISHONORED ITEM FEE. Borrower will pay a fee to Lender of $32.00 if Borrower makes a payment on Borrower's loan and the check or preauthorized charge with which Borrower pays is later dishonored. RIGHT OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Borrower's accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender's option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow Lender to protect Lender's charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph. COLLATERAL. Borrower acknowledges this Agreement is secured by All Business Assets per Commercial Security Agreement dated 5/11/2014. LINE OF CREDIT. This Agreement evidences a revolving line of credit. Advances under this Agreement, as well as directions for payment from Borrower's accounts, may be requested orally or in writing by Borrower or by an authorized person. Lender may, but need not, require that all oral requests be confirmed in writing. Borrower agrees to be liable for all sums either: (A) advanced in accordance with the instructions of an authorized person or (B) credited to any of Borrower's accounts with Lender. The unpaid principal balance owing on this Agreement at any time may be evidenced by endorsements on this Agreement or by Lender's internal records, including daily computer print-outs. Lender will have no obligation to advance funds under this Agreement if: (A) Borrower or any guarantor is in default under the terms of this Agreement or any agreement that Borrower or any guarantor has with Lender, including any agreement made in connection with the signing of this Agreement; (B) Borrower or any guarantor ceases doing business or is insolvent; (C) any guarantor seeks, claims or otherwise attempts to limit, modify or revoke such guarantor's guarantee of this Agreement or any other loan with Lender; (D) Borrower has applied funds provided pursuant to this Agreement for purposes other than those authorized by Lender; or (E) Lender in good faith believes itself insecure. CONTINUING VALIDITY. Except as expressly changed by this Agreement, the terms of the original obligation or obligations, including all agreements evidenced or securing the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect. Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not waive Lender's right to strict performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any future change in terms. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a satisfaction of the obligation(s). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing. Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released by virtue of this Agreement. If any person who signed the original obligation does not sign this Agreement below, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Agreement is given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing party consents to the changes and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise will not be released by it. This waiver applies not only to any initial extension, modification or release, but also to all such subsequent actions. LOAN AGREEMENT. A document titled, \"Business Loan Agreement (Asset Based)\", is attached to this Promissory Note. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on transfer of Borrower's interest, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the Collateral becomes vested in a person other than Borrower, Lender, without notice to Borrower, may deal with Borrower's successors with reference to this Agreement and the Indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Borrower from the obligations of this Agreement or liability under the Indebtedness. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. If any part of this Agreement cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of the Agreement. Lender may delay or forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement without losing them. In addition, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies provided in the related documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and to exercise its rights and remedies.
